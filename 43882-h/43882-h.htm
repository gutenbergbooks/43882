<p>The father of Mr. <span class="smcap">Stacy Marks</span> predestined him for the coach-building
business. Providence, interposing, made him a painter, and the gaiety of
nations has been increased by the possession of some storks. In <i>Pen and
Pencil Sketches</i> (<span class="smcap">Chatto and Windus</span>) he has given the world some
reminiscences of a career justly crowned by the laurels of the Royal
Academy. The work is in two volumes, and my Baronite says would have
been more than twice as good had it been in one. The first volume is
charming, with its chat about <span class="smcap">Leigh's</span> studio and the men met there; of
<span class="smcap">Charles Keene</span> and the delightful cruise off Gravesend in the <i>William
and Mary</i>; of merry days with the St. John's Wood clique; of nights at
<span class="smcap">Arthur Lewis's</span>; and of days with <span class="smcap">Fred Walker</span>. When the flood of memory
runs dry, and there still remains a second volume to be produced, Mr.
<span class="smcap">Marks</span> grows desperate, and shovels in anything he finds handy in the
pigeon-holes of his desk. Thus the pleased reader finds reprinted
articles that appeared in the <i>Spectator</i> thirty years ago, when Mr.
<span class="smcap">Marks</span> was art critic to that respectable journal. Also there is a
description of <span class="smcap">Bampton</span>, which once thrilled the readers of the <i>Tiverton
Gazette</i>. This gives to the second volume something of the smell of an
apple store-room. But the first is good enough to atone for the burden
of the second. By a happy coincidence, whilst Mr. <span class="smcap">Du Maurier</span> in <i>Trilby</i>
has made all the world in love with <i>Little Billee</i>, he appears under
his own name in many of Mr. <span class="smcap">Marks'</span> pages, and is always the same
charming, simple-minded, sensitive man of genius. It is pleasant to read
how our Mr. <span class="smcap">Agnew</span>&mdash;"<span class="smcap">William</span>" the wise call him&mdash;gave the young painter
his first substantial lift. <span class="smcap">Walker</span> had painted a picture he called
"<i>Spring</i>," a young girl gathering primroses in a wood. Yielding to the
advice of his friends, he put on it a price the amount of which abashed
him. Mr. <span class="smcap">Agnew</span> saw the picture, recognised its merit, and wrote a cheque
for the full amount asked. When the young artist heard of his good
fortune he burst into tears, and gasping out "I must go and tell my
mother," rushed from the place. Of the original sketches with which the
volumes are enriched are some pen-and-ink drawings by <span class="smcap">Fred Walker</span>, which
reveal in a new light the painter of "<i>The Almshouse</i>." Amongst many
good stories, Mr. <span class="smcap">Marks</span> tells how he was addressed by a clergyman, who,
believing from his name that he was a Jew, invited him to look in at his
church and be converted. "<span class="smcap">Marco's</span>" reply conclusively proved his
possession of a Christian spirit.</p>

<p>Since <span class="smcap">Samuel Warren</span> wrote his <i>Diary of a Late Physician</i>,&mdash;to which, as
the Baron supposes, allusion is made in p. 200 of this book, where the
narrator says, "Thus it happens that the ablest chronicler of their
(<i>i.e.</i> medical men's) experiences in our literature was a lawyer,"&mdash;no
more interesting, and occasionally sensational, stories have appeared
than those written by Mr. <span class="smcap">Conan Doyle</span>, and published by <span class="smcap">Methuen &amp; Co.</span> in
a single volume, under the title of <i>Round the Red Lamp</i>. One of these,
<i>A Straggler of '15</i>, has been recently developed into a one act
dramatic sketch for Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>, who, in the part of the ancient veteran
"lagging superfluous," is reported to have achieved a remarkable
success. For pathos, <i>A Physiologist's Wife</i> is as perfect in style as
it is original in design; to those who want to take something strong
before going to bed, the Baron can confidently recommend <i>The Case of
Lady Sannox</i>; while for those of the inferior sex whom Providence has
blessed with nerves, the Baron prescribes to be taken, the last thing at
night, with a favourite pipe and a tumbler of the reader's special
"wanity," the story of <i>Lot No. 249</i>; "lights full up," as the stage
directions say, the door locked, and the room previously searched, in
order to be quite sure that no practical joker is in hiding behind
screen, curtains, or under table, who might think it humorous to pop out
when you are deep in the story, and "give you fits."</p>

<p>In the <i>Yellow Book</i>, No. 3, let me praise Mr. <span class="smcap">Dowson's</span> "Apple Blossoms
in Brittany"; a charming unfinished picture. You must guess what the
fruit may possibly be from the blossom. Also very good is <span class="smcap">Henry
Harland's</span> "When I am a King."</p>

<h2>TWO WAYS OF AUDITING.</h2>

<p class="caption">I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Old Way.</span></p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Scene.</span>&mdash;<i>A Chamber in a Civic Building. The Town Clerk and
the Auditor discovered at a table covered with papers.</i></p>

<p><i>Clerk.</i> Then I believe that you are entirely satisfied with the
accounts?</p>

<p><i>Auditor.</i> Oh, perfectly. (<i>After a pause.</i>) There is one item I
wanted to ask about&mdash;I've no doubt you'll be able to explain it
satisfactorily&mdash;it's this "£25 for ginger-beer to the Mayor and
Council on the occasion of opening the new Cemetery." Does not&mdash;er&mdash;that
sum represent a rather large number of bottles?</p>

<p><i>Clerk</i> (<i>in an off-hand way</i>). Well, we put down ginger-beer, you
know, as it <i>looks</i> better, and there's a rather strong temperance
party in the borough. Of course, it was really champagne&mdash;"extra
sec," too, you bet!</p>

<p><i>Auditor.</i> Oh, of course. I merely mentioned the matter for the
sake of form. And the "£15 for cigars"&mdash;that was an expenditure
incurred at the same time, I conclude?</p>

<p><i>Clerk</i> (<i>carelessly</i>). Oh, yes. Y'see, one of the Councillors is the
leading tobacconist in the place.</p>

<p><i>Auditor</i> (<i>relieved</i>). Ah, that accounts for it. Then these "models
of the Crematorium in gold and jewels, as brooches for the wives of
the Councillors"&mdash;I see they come to £105 in all.</p>

<p><i>Clerk</i> (<i>sternly</i>). You don't <i>object</i> to the brooches, I presume?</p>

<p><i>Auditor</i> (<i>anxiously</i>). Oh, not at all. Not in the least. A most&mdash;er&mdash;praiseworthy
method of spending the ratepayers' money.</p>

<p><i>Clerk.</i> Quite so. Our Mayor's our leading jeweller, you know.
So, as you've put "Examined and Approved," shall we go in to
lunch? For a "cold collation on the occasion of the audit" our
Council always allows £10. It'll be rather a good feed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Exeunt into banqueting apartment.</i></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Subsides into a chair, and takes two minutes to recover from
his fit of merriment.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Clerk</i> (<i>surprised</i>). I really fail to see where the joke comes in.</p>

<p><i>Auditor.</i> Oh, don't you know? I'm one of the new class of comic
auditors&mdash;"made in Manchester." What tickles me is this item of
£17 for gold match-boxes for lighting the cigars of the Mayor and
Aldermen on the occasion of the visit to the Sewage Farm. <i>There's</i>
persiflage, if you like!</p>

<p><i>Clerk</i> (<i>smiling</i>). I'm glad you take so humorous a view of the
matter. Of course you allow that expenditure?</p>

<p><i>Auditor.</i> Allow it! Not for worlds. Then&mdash;(<i>with difficulty restraining
another outburst of mirth</i>)&mdash;how about "£27 for oysters
and Chablis" after the visit?</p>

<p><i>Clerk.</i> The Council naturally required some refreshment at the
end of the journey&mdash;quite a quarter of a mile, in their own carriages&mdash;and
oysters were rather dear just then&mdash;a little out of season.</p>

<p><i>Auditor</i> (<i>after a guffaw</i>). Capital! "Out of season"&mdash;out of
reason, too, <i>I</i> should say. Of course I must surcharge the oysters and
Chablis. Really, I'm enjoying myself immensely!</p>

<p><i>Clerk</i> (<i>gloomily</i>). I hope the Council will feel equal enjoyment at
your report. Do you mean seriously&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Auditor.</i> Seriously! Not a bit of it. I tell you I'm a comic character.
And what better practical joke can one play than suddenly to come
down on public officials with an audit disallowing all their little personal
luxuries? Afraid I must strike out these items of "Visits to Olympia
by Corporation to inspect the lighting arrangements," and "Ditto at
Empire and Alhambra Theatres." No doubt the Aldermen will be
glad to pay for them themselves. Now I think the business is finished.
Lunch? No, thanks. A screaming joke like this is lunch enough
for me.</p>

<h2>THE POLITE GUIDE TO THE CIVIL SERVICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By an Affable Philosopher and Courteous Friend.</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">How to Enter the Civil Service.</span></p>

<p>In the good old days of yore there was little trouble in obtaining
admission to the Civil Service. All that was necessary was a slight
knowledge of a Cabinet Minister, and a smattering of schooling. The
latter might be obtained at Eton, Winchester, Rugby, Westminster, or
Harrow. The acquaintance of the Minister, of course, had to be made by
your father. You were too young to have attracted the attention of so
important a personage. Suppose you had reached the mature age of
eighteen, and had given up the round jackets and collars of boyhood, and
had assumed "stick-ups" and "cutaways," your father would probably ask
you "What you intended to do next?"</p>

<p>"No, my dear fellow," would be the paternal reply to a suggestion about
Trinity or Christ Church. "I am afraid I can't manage either. You see,
your two elder brothers went to the University, but then we could find
<i>them</i> family livings. It would be useless to let you read for the Bar,
because we haven't any of us married into a single firm of Solicitors;
and in these hard times I really can't afford to buy you a commission."</p>

<p>You would notice <i>sotto voce</i> that when ways and means were being
discussed, times were always hard.</p>

<p>"I suppose you could be a doctor if you pleased; but walking the
hospitals is not a particularly pleasant occupation. Then there is
another opening&mdash;why not try the Civil Service?"</p>

<p>You would rather freshen up at this. You would have read in a comic
paper, that never will be nameless, that Government clerks were like the
fountains in Trafalgar Square (old style), "because they played from ten
to four."</p>

<p>"Well, yes," you would return. "I don't think I should mind that so
much. It would be rather fun to go to Paris as an <i>attaché</i>."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I couldn't quite manage that, my dear boy," your fond parent
would respond. "They don't pay <i>attachés</i> at first, and so you would
have to be satisfied with the War Office or the Admiralty instead of the
Foreign Office."</p>

<p>"All right, Pater," you would say, and leave the matter in the hands of
the elder generation.</p>

<p>Then your father would write to any Cabinet Minister of his acquaintance
about things in general and nothing in particular, and would add a
"P.S." asking for a nomination. In due course a reply would come
granting the sweet boon. A test examination would follow of a
perfunctory character, and an intimation of your appointment would be
the sequel. Then you would take up your daily residence in Pall Mall or
Whitehall for twenty or thirty years and then retire as a Knight or a
C.B. Thus was done in the comparatively long ago. But now-a-days another
plan has to be adopted.</p>

<p>Instead of entering the Civil Service as a junior join it as a senior.
As a preliminary you must get into the House. This is simpler than
having to cram and then stand the racket of a competitive examination.
Any one under certain conditions can enter Parliament, but the Civil
Service Commissioners bar the entrance to the Government offices with
equally certain regulations. For the sake of argument let me assume that
you are in the House. You have stood for Slocum-on-the-Marsh, and have
persuaded the Slocum-on-the-Marshers to elect you. As an M.P. you are
duly qualified to accept any appointment under the Crown when the
Government ask you. The best plan is to think of an office and then add
one to it&mdash;yourself.</p>

<p>"Why not the Public Squander Department?" you ask yourself. To which you
reply with a second question, "Why not?"</p>

<p>Yes, the P. S. D. is not half bad. But how to get into it. Well, why not
take up Milestones? All the world knows that the Public Squander
Department are responsible for all the Milestones not under the
superintendence of the county authorities. Go for the Milestones.</p>

<p>Begin with a question. Learn that the Milestones in the Old Bath Road
are in many cases illegible. Request the Secretary of the Public
Squander Department to inform you when the inscription of such and such
a Milestone was last restored? The official will fence the query.
Probably his Private Secretary, considering you a new man, will have
failed to furnish the necessary information. You must expect a little
retardation at the first set-off.</p>

<p>And here let me point out for your future guidance the importance of
having a private secretary thoroughly up to his work. Had your answerer
been possessed of the proper sort of assistant you would have been
discovered, respectfully button-holed, and perforce satisfied. You would
never have had the heart to put your question about the Milestones. But
the particular Private Secretary of your answerer being <i>not</i> up to his
work you get snubbed.</p>

<p>But don't be discouraged; stick to your Milestones.</p>

</div>

<p>Bombard "the Right Hon. Gentleman opposite" with questions. Ask him for
particulars about the Milestones in the Old Kent Road and on Salisbury
Plain. If he requests notice, give him notice. By degrees you will find
that you are becoming an institution. Milestones are your specialty.
When the House is sitting demand particulars. When the House is up,
write to the papers. Move for returns about Milestones. Go down to
Slocum-on-the-Marsh and read papers on Milestones. If possible, be made
a F.S.A. on the strength of your knowledge of Milestones. So identify
yourself with Milestones that when your name is casually mentioned
anywhere, let it be common form for some one to say, "Of course, the
chap who looks after the Milestones."</p>

<p>Wait patiently until your side move over from the Opposition to the
Government benches. Then will come your opportunity. You will have sat
upon a Milestone Commission. You have been very instrumental in getting
Milestones polished. You have caused Milestones to be multiplied. All
these services must be recognised. And they will.</p>

<p>You will find yourself offered the Secretaryship of the Public Squander
Department&mdash;to take care of the Milestones. Accept it. You will now have
become a Civil Servant. On some future occasion I may suggest how you
may successfully perform your duties in your new position.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>A Story in Scenes.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">PART XVIII.&mdash;THE LAST STRAW.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Scene XXVII.</span> (<i>continued</i>).&mdash;<i>The Chinese Drawing Room.</i> <span class="smcap">Spurrell's</span>
<i>ingenuous remark upon the coincidence of the title of the
volume in his hand with the name of his bull-dog has produced
a painful silence, which no one has sufficient presence of mind
to break for several seconds.</i></p>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane</i> (<i>to herself</i>). Not <span class="smcap">Clarion Blair</span>! Not even a
poet! I&mdash;I could <i>slap</i> him!</p>

<p><i>Pilliner</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Poor dear <span class="smcap">Vivien</span>! But if people will insist
on patting a strange poet, they mustn't be surprised if they get a
nasty bite!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself</i>). He <i>didn't</i> write <i>Andromeda!</i> Then he
hasn't got my letter after all! And I've been such a <i>brute</i> to the poor
dear man! <i>How</i> lucky I said nothing about it to <span class="smcap">Gerald</span>!</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse</i> (<i>to himself</i>). So he <i>ain't</i> the bard!... Now I
see why <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>'s been behavin' so oddly all the evenin'; she spotted
him, and didn't like to speak out. Tried to give me a hint, though.
Well, I shall stay out my leave now!</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda</i> (<i>to herself</i>). I thought all along he seemed too good a
sort for a poet!</p>

<p><i>Archie</i> (<i>to himself</i>). It's all very well; but how about that skit he
went up to write on us? He <i>must</i> be a poet of sorts.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Brooke-Chatteris</i> (<i>to herself</i>). This is fearfully puzzling. What
made him say that about "Lady Grisoline"?</p>

<p><i>The Bishop</i> (<i>to himself</i>). A crushing blow for the Countess; but not
unsalutary. I am distinctly conscious of feeling more kindly disposed to
that young man. Now why?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He ponders.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lady Lullington</i> (<i>to herself</i>). I thought this young man was going to
read us some of his poetry; it's too tiresome of him to stop to tell us
about his bull-dog. As if anybody cared <i>what</i> he called it!</p>

<p><i>Lord Lullington</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Uncommonly awkward, this! If I could
catch <span class="smcap">Laura's</span> eye&mdash;but I suppose it would hardly be decent to go just
yet.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin</i> (<i>to herself</i>). Can <span class="smcap">Rohesia</span> have known this? What
possible object could she have had in&mdash;&mdash;And oh, dear, how disgusted
<span class="smcap">Rupert</span> will be!</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Seems a decent young chap enough! Too bad
of <span class="smcap">Rohesia</span> to let him in for this. I don't care a straw what he is&mdash;he's
none the worse for not being a poet.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>to herself</i>). What <i>is</i> he maundering about? It's
utterly inconceivable that <i>I</i> should have made any mistake. It's only
too clear what the cause is&mdash;<i>Claret!</i></p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>aloud, good-humouredly</i>). Too bad of you to try and spoof
me like this before everybody, Miss <span class="smcap">Spelwane</span>! I don't know whose idea it
was to play me such a trick, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelw.</i> (<i>indistinctly</i>). Please understand that nobody here had
the <i>least</i> intention of playing a trick upon you!</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> Well, if you say so, of course&mdash;&mdash;But it looked rather like it,
asking me to read when I've about as much poetry in me as&mdash;as a pot hat!
Still, if I'm <i>wanted</i> to read aloud, I shall be happy to oblige&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> (<i>hastily</i>). Indeed, <i>indeed</i>, Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>, we couldn't
think of troubling you under the circumstances! (<i>In desperation.</i>)
<span class="smcap">Vivien</span>, my dear, won't you <i>sing</i> something?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>The company echo the request with unusual eagerness.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> (<i>to himself, during</i> Miss <span class="smcap">Spelwane's</span> <i>song</i>). Wonder what's
put them off being read to all of a sudden. (<i>As his eye happens to
rest on the binding of the volume on his knee.</i>) Hullo! This cover's
pink, with silver things, not unlike cutlets, on it! Didn't <span class="smcap">Emma</span>
ask me&mdash;&mdash;? By George, if it's <i>that!</i> I may get down to the
Housekeeper's Room, after all! As soon as ever this squalling stops
I'll find out; I <i>can't</i> go on like this! (Miss <span class="smcap">Spelwane</span> <i>leaves the
piano; everybody plunges feverishly into conversation on the first
subject&mdash;other than poetry or dogs&mdash;that presents itself, until</i> Lord
<i>and</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Lullington</span> <i>set a welcome example of departure.</i>) Better
wait till these county nobs have cleared, I suppose&mdash;there goes the
last of 'em&mdash;now for it!... (<i>He pulls himself together, and approaches
his host and hostess.</i>) Hem, Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>, and your ladyship,
it's occurred to me that it's just barely possible you may have
got it into your heads that I was something in the <i>poetical</i> way.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Not this poor young chap's fault; must let
him down as easily as possible! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Not at all&mdash;not at all!
Ha&mdash;assure you we quite understand; no necessity to say another word
about it.</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Just my luck! They quite understand! No
Housekeeper's Room for me this journey! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Of course I knew the
Countess, there, and Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>, were fully aware all along&mdash;&mdash;(<i>To</i>
Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>, <i>as stifled exclamations reach his ear.</i>) You <i>were</i>,
weren't you?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>hastily</i>). Yes, yes, Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>. Of course! It's all
<i>perfectly</i> right!</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> (<i>to the others</i>). You see, I should never have thought of
coming in as a visitor if it hadn't been for the Countess; she would
<i>have</i> it that it was all right, and that I needn't be afraid I
shouldn't be welcome.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> To be sure&mdash;any friend of my sister-in-law's&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> <span class="smcap">Albinia</span>, I have refrained from speech as long as possible;
but this is really <i>too</i> much! You <i>don't</i> suppose I should have
introduced Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span> here unless I had had the strongest reasons for
knowing, however he may be pleased to mystify us now, that he, and
nobody else, is the author of <i>Andromeda!</i> And I, for one, absolutely
decline to believe in this preposterous story of his about a bull-dog.</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> But your ladyship must have known! Why, you as good as asked me
on the way here to put you down for a bull-pup!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> Never, never! A bull-pup is the last creature I should ever
dream of coveting. You were obliging enough to ask me to accept a
presentation copy of your verses.</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> Was I? I don't exactly see how I <i>could</i> have been, considering
I never made a rhyme in my life!</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> There, there, <span class="smcap">Rohesia</span>, it was <i>your</i> mistake; but as we are
indebted to it for the pleasure of making Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>'s
acquaintance&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> I am not in the habit of making mistakes, <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>. I don't
know what you and <span class="smcap">Albinia</span> and <span class="smcap">Maisie</span> may know that I am in ignorance of,
but, since you seem to have been aware from the first that Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>
was not the poet you had invited here to meet me, will you kindly
explain what has become of the <i>real</i> author?</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> My dear <span class="smcap">Rohesia</span>, I don't know and I don't <i>care!</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> There you are <i>wrong</i>, <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>, because it's obvious that if
he is not Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>, his absence has to be accounted for in <i>some</i>
way.</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> By Jove, I believe I can put you on the track. I shouldn't
wonder if he's the party these dress clothes of mine belong to! I
daresay you may have noticed they don't look as if they were made for
me?</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> (<i>closing her eyes</i>). Pray let us avoid any sartorial discussions!
We are waiting to hear about this person.</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> Well, I found I'd got on his things by mistake, and I went
up as soon as I could after dessert to my room to take 'em off, and
there he was, with a waste-paper basket on his head&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> A waste-paper basket on his head! And pray what
should he have <i>that</i> for?</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> He said he wouldn't take it off till he saw me. And I
never saw anyone in such a mess with ink and flour as he was!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> Ink and flour, indeed! This rigmarole gets more
ridiculous every moment! You can't seriously expect anyone here to
believe it!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Archie</span> <i>discreetly retires to the smoking-room.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> Well, I rather think somebody must have fixed up a booby trap
for <i>me</i>, you know, and he happened to go in first and get the benefit
of it. And he was riled, very naturally, thinking <i>I</i>'d done it, but
after we'd had a little talk together, he calmed down and said I might
keep his clothes, which I thought uncommonly good-natured of him, you
know. By the way, he gave me his card. Here it is, if your ladyship
would like to see it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He hands it to</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Culverin</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> "Mr. <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>!" ... <span class="smcap">Rohesia</span>, that <i>is</i> <span class="smcap">Clarion
Blair</span>! I <i>knew</i> it was <i>something</i> ending in "ell." (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>.)
And you say Mr. <span class="smcap">Undershell</span> is here&mdash;in this house?</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> Not now. He's gone by this time.</p>

<p><i>The Others</i> (<i>in dismay</i>). Gone!</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> He said he was leaving at once. If he'd only told me how
it was, I'd have&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> I don't believe a single word of all this! If Mr.
<span class="smcap">Spurrell</span> is not <span class="smcap">Clarion Blair</span>, let him explain how he came to be
coming down to Wyvern this afternoon!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Partial reaction in company.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> If your ladyship doesn't really know, you had better ask
Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>; <i>he</i>'ll tell you it's all right.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> Then perhaps <i>you</i> will be good enough to enlighten
us, <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>?</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> (<i>driven into a corner</i>). Why, 'pon my word, I'm bound
to say that I'm just as much in the dark as anybody else, if it comes
to that!</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> (<i>eagerly</i>). But you wired me to come, Sir! About a horse
of yours! I've been wondering all the evening when you'd tell me
I could go round and have a look at him. I'm here instead of
Mr. <span class="smcap">Spavin</span>&mdash;<i>now</i> do you understand, Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>? I'm the Vet.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Suppressed sensation.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). This is devilish awkward! Don't quite
know what to do. (<i>Aloud.</i>) To&mdash;to be sure you are! Of course!
That's it, <span class="smcap">Rohesia</span>! Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span> came down to see a horse, and
we shall be very glad to have the benefit of his opinion by-and-by.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He claps him amicably on the shoulder.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> (<i>in a sepulchral tone</i>). <span class="smcap">Albinia</span>, I think I will go to
bed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>She withdraws.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). There'll be no harm in letting him stay,
now he <i>is</i> here. If <span class="smcap">Rohesia</span> objects, she's got nobody but herself to
blame for it!</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). They won't want to keep me upstairs much
longer after this! (<span class="smcap">Tredwell</span> <i>enters, and seems to have something
of importance to communicate to</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert</span> <i>in private.</i>) I wonder
what the dooce is up <i>now!</i></p>

<h2>THE NEW CANDIDATE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;I trust you will give me the hospitality of your
columns (and thus save me the cost of extensive advertising) to announce
that I intend to offer myself as a candidate for all the eleven
divisions at the forthcoming School Board Election. I do this for
several reasons. In the first place, as I have no more chance in any one
place more than in any other, I feel it quite impossible to make any
choice. Besides, to be elected at the top of eleven polls would be an
unique distinction, second only to being defeated at the bottom of
eleven. In the next place, as I can find no other persons who will come
forward on my platform, I am bound to offer myself everywhere. My views
are extensive, not to say peculiar. On the religious question, I agree
with everything that has been said by everybody. I hope in this way to
avoid incurring <i><span xml:lang="la">odium theologicum</span></i> of any kind. I am in favour of no
one paying rates unless he has children actually at a Board School. I am
told that this will not secure for me the Labour Vote, but it ought, at
any rate, to rally to my side all the "intelligent and respectable." On
all other points I believe I am well fitted to sit on the London School
Board. I understand that at its meetings oysters and Chablis are
sometimes the order of the day. If I am returned, my main object, I avow
it frankly, will be to make them the standing order. Soliciting the vote
of every patriotic citizen, I am,</p>

<h2>LOCAL COLOUR.</h2>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Asquith</span> was reported the other day to have said that the Government
was spoken of as having been accused of refusing so-called amendments to
the Employers' Liability Bill in "<i>peacock</i> temper." The <i>Daily News</i>,
in referring to this, suggests that "peacock temper" was a misprint for
"pique, or temper." But surely this is not so. Mr. <span class="smcap">Asquith</span> evidently has
given in his adhesion to the new system of "colour adjectives." This
opens great possibilities to the future. Radicals will denounce the
"scarlet scandals of the purple-clad peers." Tories will wax eloquent on
"the pink miasma of revolutionary Radicalism." No one will know what it
all means, but that is part of the programme. Even if this colour scheme
will not work, there is still a justification for the Asquithian phrase.
Everybody has heard of a "foul slander." Why not a "peacock temper"?</p>

<h2>INS AND OUTS.</h2>

<p>"Cricket was a far superior game to golf or tennis," said Lord <span class="smcap">Knutsford</span>
to the members of the Victoria Park Cricket Association; and he went on
to tell a story of the first introduction of cricket to Tonga, one of
the Pacific Islands. Everybody took up the game so heartily that State
affairs were allowed to slide altogether, and at last the King of <span class="smcap">Tonga</span>
had to lay down rules as to the times when the game might be indulged
in. "Even then the Prime Minister was with difficulty prevented from
bowling during forbidden hours." For Tonga read Westminster&mdash;where a
good deal of <i>tongue</i>&mdash;ah!&mdash;goes on&mdash;and we get a result something like
this:&mdash;</p>

<p>"After the usual luncheon interval, the Leader of the Opposition and the
ex-Umpire-General faced the delivery of the First Commissioner of Stumps
and the Scorin' Secretary. The punishment inflicted by the former on the
bowling led to a Cabinet crisis, ending in the Secretary of State
resigning his office and the leather to the Lord High Wicket-keep. The
result of this change was soon apparent, for the Leader of the
Opposition was clean bowled by a quotation from <i>Hansard</i>, and his place
was taken by a prominent member from below the Opposition Gangway.</p>

<p>"As the score still mounted, the Ministry decided to apply the Closure
to the game, an effort which was resisted by the whole force of the
Opposition, armed with pads and wickets. During the all-night innings
which ensued the Prime Minister retired hurt, and the Ministry were
finally driven into the Pavilion, where they expressed a decided
intention, in consequence of the underhand bowling of their opponents,
of at once appealing to the country. The Committee of Lords' has placed
its veto on these disorderly proceedings, and 'Down with the Lords' is
likely to be the Ministerial rallying-cry during the forthcoming
Election."</p>

<h2>THE ART OF NAVAL PLATITUDE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;Dear Sir,&mdash;As an able-bodied seaman and expert on the marine
serpent and other such questions of the hour, I have been very properly
asked for my opinion on the late collisions in the far East. Lest my
utterances should be misrepresented by journals unaccustomed to deal
with refinements of maritime phraseology, I send you a correct report of
my interview.</p>

<p>"What deduction," began the reporter from the recesses of a deck-chair
that had figured at Trafalgar, "do you make with regard to the future of
naval warfare from the engagements of which we have lately read such
distracting accounts?"</p>

<p>"My leading deduction," I replied, "is that it is difficult beforehand
to conjecture which side is going to win, and impossible afterwards to
discover which has actually won. History, however, and a long course of
technical experience, alike convince me that, given equal courage and
skill on both sides, vessels equally well equipped and armoured and of
precisely similar shape, tonnage, and fighting power, victory may be
expected, in many cases out of a few more, to fall to the party that is
<i>numerically the stronger of the two</i>. You are, perhaps, with me on this
point?"</p>

<p>"I confess," he replied, "that you throw for me a new and lurid light on
a question always difficult for the lay mind to grapple with. But tell
me of the torpedo and its mission."</p>

<p>"The deadliness," I said, "of this modern weapon of naval warfare is to
be fully appreciated by such alone as have been its unhappy victims. In
the incredibly short space of time between the moment of impact and the
decease of those who are, as an immediate result, blown to
indistinguishable atoms, no reliable evidence has, in the nature of
things, been taken down from the lips of the people best qualified to
submit it.</p>

<p>"Disconnected fragments of speech, chiefly of a profane character,
constitute the sole testimony upon which we have to base our
conclusions. But we may safely affirm that one of the most, if not <i>the</i>
most, important detail in the manipulation of this projectile is the
aim. Wrongly directed it is comparatively innocuous. In the unavoidable
hurry and confusion of the moment, when the attention of the operator is
diverted by the reiterated play of missiles upon his person, possibly a
prey at the very time to insufferable nausea, it is almost impossible to
guarantee the missile from aberration. You will pardon my
technicalities?"</p>

<p>"I thank you," he replied, "and I follow you. But in what way do you
account for the success of the Japanese with these submarine weapons?"</p>

<p>"Peruse the reports," I answered, "and draw your own deductions. '<i>On
the morning of the 18th</i>' (the morrow of the battle) '<i>the Japanese
flotilla of torpedo-boats returned to the Yalu and leisurely destroyed
with torpedoes several stranded Chinese vessels</i>.'</p>

<p>"Here we have the best conceivable endorsement of my views. That which
in the excitement of the fray they were impotent to achieve, this, with
fitting leisure, unhampered by the annoyance of hostile opposition, and
with the object rigidly fixed, as in a vice, they effected with
unqualified and unquestioned success."</p>

<p>Dazzled by my reflections he proceeded to put a fresh conundrum to me.
"What say you," he asked, "to the resources of China? I see that the
Dowager Empress has sent three millions of taels to the forces."</p>

<p>"The tael," I explained, "is excellent eating. I perceive no immediate
reason for the evacuation of Peking as far as the supply of game is
concerned. This, however, is a side issue, and not strictly nautical in
its bearing.</p>

<p>"To proceed at once, and in conclusion, to the matter of our own naval
supremacy" (for I saw this inevitable question already framed on his
lips), "I will give you in a word the accumulated wisdom of long years
of naval intuition. My motto is '<i>Always win!</i>'</p>

<p>"Once let the enemy, however inferior, win, and for the time being you
are beaten. We are&mdash;and here I rely not only on my own observation, but
on the testimony of countless myriads of my species&mdash;<i>we are an insular
nation</i>. Further, <i>our commerce is largely dependent on our
merchandise</i>. It was not till I had realised to the full these two
momentous and crucial facts that I arrived at the conclusion which I
have already imparted to you, and now venture to repeat&mdash;'<i>Always win!</i>'
You bear me out, I imagine?"</p>

<p>"I bear myself," he affably replied; thus concluding an interview in the
course of which there had been no manner of hitch except the usual
nautical one at the moment of his coming aboard; and that was due not to
the absence of braces, but to respect for my position as an Admiralty
Crichton.</p>

<p>There, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, you are welcome to make any use you will of a
statement that contains practically and tactically the final word on the
future of naval warfare.</p>
